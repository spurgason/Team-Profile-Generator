# Team Profile Generator

## Description
This project is a command-line application that uses Node.js to fill out and generate an employee information page. This application will allow the user to add a manager, engineers, and employees to their work roster. Each employee will be given a role and Id, with a form of contact which will be there email. Each role also has their own specific item relating to their field. 

## Installation
Users must have Node.js to run and need to install the inquirer npm module to run this application.

## Usage
After installation users can run the application in the command line by typing “node index” to initialize the application. This will then trigger a series of questions regarding the employees and their function at the workplace. Once the user is finished a rendered HTML file will be loaded in the dist folder that will be filled out using the users input.
